### spawning:
	sort players by team at the start
	force players onto penguins at the start

### penguin:

	faster search interval for mounting players
	increase base penguin speed
	decrease max penguin speed

	increase base penguin turn rate greatly
	lower penguin turn rate based on current speed

### rework map; shorter, prettier, more clear on where to go
	and stop players from skipping ahead to areas where they shouldnt be yet

### remove enemy invokers
	make starting invoker play a 'cutscene' where he summons the heroes at the start
	have him explain they need to escape the mountain
		pan camera across the map, showing the path you must take
    
	have winter wyvern interrupt him near the end of his explaination and curse him
	  invoker glimpses her just before she casts?

### remove extra winter wyverns
	have main ww be perched somewhere high, occasionally flying in to mess with players

### rework item giving method
    someway, somehow we need to stop players from taking multiple items from them
    
    just making a trigger that gives a random item seems most feasible
